Filtering in Spatial Domain: \
1- Apply each spatial filters to the image according to the below table and compare the original image and the image after using the filter.


| Section | Filter name          | Size of Filter | Image  |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| a       | Average(Mean) filter | 5 * 5          | image1 |
| b       | Median filter        | 5 * 5          | image2 |
| c       | Laplacian filter     | 5 * 5          | image3 |
| d       | Sobel(X and Y) filter| 7 * 7          | image4 |



Filtering in Frequency Domain: \
2- Apply frequency filters in each case and compare the original image and the image after using the filter:

(a) Apply frequency spectrum with Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), centered spectrum, decentralized spectrum and inverse FFT on image5 and show them. \
(b) Apply Ideal Low Pass Filter (ILPF) and Ideal High Pass Filter (IHPF) on image5 and show them. \
(c) Apply Gaussian Smoothing with 3, 5,7and 9 kernel size on image6 and show them.

Morphology Operators \
3-In inspection of electronic circuit cards there is a need to inspect the number of holes and the diameter of the holes, ‘holes.jpg’.
We want to measure the number of holes and their diameter using morphology.
