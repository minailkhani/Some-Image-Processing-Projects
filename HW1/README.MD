Exercise 1 — deadline: 3-4-2023

Sampling and quantization: \
1- Load and display image1 and answer the below question:

a) Compute the difference between values in neighboring pixels, find the number of bytes and size of the image, and display each case.

b) Representation of the image with unit-8 data type, default type (float 64), and by adding bias (128) and plot it.

c) How many bits can we manage to still have a good image? Plot all of the cases.

Geometrical spatial operations:

1- Perform the scaling (1.5*1.5), translation, and rotation (90°) operations for Figure 2 and plot the final image in each case.

Histogram equalization:

1- First, display Gaussian Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Cumulative Mass Function (CMF) with mu=0 and sigma=1 second, apply histogram equalization and histogram matching transform in the image3 third, plot each histogram and compare them.
