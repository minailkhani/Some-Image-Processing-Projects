1- Create artificial images with data augmentation including (flipping, histogram equalization, rotation, translation, shearing and etc.) and add them in the dataset.

2- Separate 80% of the dataset for training dataset and 20% for test dataset.

3- Display the total number of dataset color images after the data augmentation step.

4- Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) according to the following structure:


5- Training the model with the following parameters on the dataset:


| Batch size        | Number of epochs   | Learning rate | Loss function             |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 100               | 500                | 0.0001        | Binary Cross Entropy       |


5- Display variation of each epoch in training accuracy and loss function.

6- Display model performance metrics including: confusion matrix, loss, accuracy, precision, recall and specificity.

7- Try another model.
